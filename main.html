		<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	     <p> “Time complexity is a concept in computer science that deals with the quantification of the amount of time taken by a set of code or algorithm to process or run as a function of the amount of input. In other words, time complexity is essentially efficiency, or how long a program function takes to process a given input.”</p>
          <p> <b>“Space Complexity</b>is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm needs to run to completion. The term ‘Space Complexity’ is sometimes misunderstood as the maximum space required by an algorithm, but it actually refers to the total space taken by an algorithm with respect to the input size. This includes both auxiliary space and space used by the input. For example, if we say space complexity is O(n)</p>

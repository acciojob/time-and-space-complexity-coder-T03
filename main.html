	<h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a concept in computer science that deals with the quantification of the amount of time taken by a set of code or algorithm to process or run as a function of the amount of input. In essence, time complexity is essentially about efficiency, or how long a program function takes to process a given input.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is another important factor to consider. It is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm needs to run to completion. The term 'Space Complexity' is sometimes misunderstood as the maximum space required by an algorithm, but it actually refers to the total space taken by an algorithm with respect to the input size. This includes both auxiliary space and space used by the input. For instance, if we say space complexity is 'O(n)', it means the space required by the algorithm increases linearly with the size of the input.</p>

		<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
     <p>Time Complexity is a measure used to evaluate the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to complete as a function of the size of the input. It helps assess how an algorithm scales as the input grows, with common classifications such as O(1), O(n), O(log n), and O(n^2). Efficient algorithms aim to minimize the time complexity, particularly for larger inputs, ensuring faster performance and resource optimization. An algorithm with lower time complexity will generally perform better, especially when processing large datasets, thus making it more efficient.</p>

    <b>Space complexity </b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the input size. When an algorithm has a space complexity of O(n), it means that the memory required grows linearly with the size of the input. For example, if the input size doubles, the space required will also double. This type of space complexity, O(n), typically occurs when an algorithm uses a data structure (like an array or list) that stores elements proportional to the input size, requiring a linear amount of memory to process. Optimizing space complexity is crucial for applications with limited memory resources or large datasets.
